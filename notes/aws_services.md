# IAM: Users and Groups

Identity and Access Management

- **Global service**
- **Root** account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- **Users** are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- **Groups** only contain users, not other groups
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

## IAM: Permissions

- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS you apply the **least privilege principle**: don't give more permissions than a user needs

## IAM Policy Structure

- Consists of:
  - Version: policy language version, always include "20 12-10-17"
  - Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
  - Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
- Statements consists of:
  - Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
  - Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
- Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
- Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies
- Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to
