# Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is the **on-demand** delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services

Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

## The Deployment Models of the Cloud

Private Cloud:

- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
- Complete control
- Security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business needs

Public Cloud:

- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
- Six advandtages of cloud computing

Hybrid Cloud:

- Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- On-demand self service:
  - Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- Broad network access:
  - Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
  - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
  - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
- Rapid elasticity and scalability:
  - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
  - Quickly and easily scale based on demand
- Measured service:
  - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
  - Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
  - Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Stop guessing capacity
  - Scale based on actual measured usage
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

## Problems solved by the Cloud

- Flexibility: change resource types when needed
- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
- Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
- Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

## Example of Cloud Computing Types

- Infrastructure as a Service:
  - Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
  - GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
- Platform as a Service:
  - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
  - Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
- Software as a Service:
  - Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
  - Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

## Aws Regions

- AWS has Regions all around the world
- Names can be us-east-I, eu-west-3...
- A region is a cluster of data centers
- Most AWS services are region-scoped
- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6).
- Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity

## AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400+ Edge Locations & 10+
- Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
